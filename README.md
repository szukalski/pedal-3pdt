3PDT breakout board with LED and CLR.

This repository contains:

* A gerber file to produce the PCB.
* A gerber file to produce the PCB with a location specified for the production number if using JLCPCB.

There is no support supplied or guaranteed for the PCB. I have built it and it works, YMMV.

## Build notes

* Power (9V) goes into SW.
* If you want to bypass the LED altogether, then jumper where indicated.
* If you want to bypass the CLR, then jumper it.
